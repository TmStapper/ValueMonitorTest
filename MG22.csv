This article takes a micro-grid composed of the power distribution such as wind power and photovoltaic (PV), EVCSs and energy storage systems (ESS) as the research object. The uncertainties of EVs’ charging demand and distributed renewable energy output are considered. A robust optimization model for the location of charging stations with distributed energy is proposed based on the combination of the road network and the grid. Load fluctuation rate is used to evaluate the degree of fit between the renewable energy uncertain output curve and the charging demand curve to determine the appropriate capacity of the wind and PV generation system and ESS. The method of kernel density estimation is used to improve the issue of over-conservatism of the robust optimization. Finally, a simulation is carried out on a network which consists of an IEEE 33-node power distribution network and a 25-node transportation system. The robustness and economy of the model are demonstrated by the results of simulation given. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle charging stations; Energy storage systems; Location; Renewable energy; Robust optimization","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Location; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Wind power; Charging demands; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging station; Energy; Energy output; Energy storage system; Renewable energies; Robust optimization; Storage systems; Electric vehicles; alternative energy; detection method; electric vehicle; energy storage; equipment; optimization; photovoltaic system; simulation; wind power"

In the proposed model, suppliers and consumers of three energy carrier of power, heat, and hydrogen are considered. This system further consists of multi-energy storage systems such as plug-in electric vehicle aggregators, thermal energy storage, and hydrogen energy storage with the application of power-to-hydrogen and hydrogen-to-power technologies. Furthermore, the Latin Hypercube Sampling method has been utilized to manage the uncertainties. In addition, a penalty function and a power exchange pricing model are evaluated by the electrical marginal price of each microgrid to determine the agreed power exchange among the MEMGs. The suggested work performs over a MAS with three MEMGs. The total profit of each microgrid is maximized over a 24-h scheduling in three diverse case studies. Ultimately, the proposed decentralized bi-level optimization approach, by converging through seven iterations, indicates an effective performance as a promising solution to a MAS-based framework. Besides, the optimal scheduling of the MEMGs were converged in the same profit for the diverse network topologies. Implementing multi-energy storage systems plays a major role in increasing total profit of MEMGs and improving the reliability performance of MAS-based structure. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralized energy management; Hydrogen energy storage; Multi-agent system; Multi-energy microgrid; Plug-in electric vehicle; Progressive hedging algorithm","Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Profitability; Scheduling; Software agents; Decentralised; Decentralized energy; Decentralized energy management; Hydrogen energy storages; Microgrid; Multi energy; Multi-energy microgrid; Power; Progressive hedging algorithm; Stochastic optimization approach; Multi agent systems; algorithm; detection method; electric vehicle; energy storage; optimization; stochasticity"

A reward-based demand response program is considered in the proposed framework to realize demand-side management and boost the economic performance of the MMG system. Besides, conditional value-at-risk as a proper risk-averse index is incorporated into the developed mixed-integer programming formulation to hedge the risk of the low profits associated with worst scenarios. For this study, the uncertainty of energy market price, electrical load, and power generation of renewable energy sources are taken into account through employing stochastic programming. Meanwhile, given the global policy for emissions reduction, an emission constraint is considered into the model, ensuring a more green trading strategy. The obtained simulation results over a 24-h time horizon, demonstrate that increasing the risk factor leads to the profit decrement by almost 30.37% while the conservativeness of the MMG against the risk is improved. Also, the results reveal that by increasing the value of emission factor, the system's profit is decreased by about 30.03% while the MMG would be operated more environmental-friendly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Combined heat and power; Conditional value-at-risk; Demand response; Emissions; Energy and reserve scheduling; Multi-microgrids","Commerce; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Emission control; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; Combined-Heat and Power; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Demand response; Emission; Energy; Energy and reserve scheduling; Grid-connected; Microgrid systems; Multi micro-grids; Risk averse; Integer programming; alternative energy; demand-side management; energy management; energy market; linear programing; power generation; risk factor; simulation"

The studied system presents a commercial building power system that combines a photovoltaic array (PV), fuel cell (FC), a battery storage system and a bidirectional DC/AC grid converter. The integration of multiple power sources like renewables leads to techno-economical challenges including power quality, stability, fuel consumption, and efficiency. The proposed EMS is based on the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). This algorithm has been implemented because of considerable advantages such as its convergence properties and its reduced computing complexity. The step-by-step design of the proposed method is detailed. Then HIL tests are performed to validate the proposed EMS performances. The performance of the proposed EMS is compared with the state machine control strategy (SMC) in terms of system efficiency and fuel consumption where the obtained results prove the superiority of the proposed EMS (5.2 % fuel saving). Regarding the power quality, the proposed EMS is compared with EMS based PSO to investigate the optimizer influence, the obtained results confirm the ability of the proposed EMS to provide a superior power quality.

Based on the energy supply structure of CCHP-MG system, this paper constructs a 3E performance evaluation index system for the CCHP-MG system from economy, environment and energy dimensions. Then, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework is designed, involving integrated weighting method based on anti-entropy weight method and grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (grey-DEMATEL), and improved technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) with difference and quotient grey relation analysis (DQGRA). 8 building-typed CCHP-MG systems are taken as examples for analysis. The results show that the benefits of system energy supply, equivalent emission reduction of pollutants, energy utilization and equivalent energy saving are important manifestations of CCHP-MG's 3E performance, and raising energy supply scale and renewable energy proportion are the key ways to improve CCHP-MG's 3E performance.

Each MG uses historical data to predict its consumers' load demand, wind speed, and solar irradiance in the first stage. In the second stage, the cooperative game method is used to determine the MG's daily dispatch and energy transaction. The paper develops a prediction model using artificial neural network (ANN) and rough neuron water cycle (RNWC) algorithms, called deep learning artificial neural network (DLANN), which is a combination of technology from the artificial neural network and WC algorithm in order to predict uncertain parameters. The above model is implemented in the 33bus power distribution system; the simulation results show that the DLANN method provides more accurate predictions than the ANN method. The results also show that a MG can achieve energy cost savings through an alliance of MGs using the cooperative game approach. Furthermore, analysis of the impact of the ESS on the operation of the MG shows that the absence of the ESS will reduce the power output of the wind turbine. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Energy management of micro-grids; Energy storage system; Forecasting; Game theory; Neural network","Deep learning; Digital storage; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Forecasting; Game theory; Neural networks; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Wind turbines; Artificial neural network methods; Cooperative game; Demand response; Energy management of micro-grid; Energy storage system; Game approach; Microgrid; Multi-stages; Neural-networks; Storage systems; Energy management; artificial neural network; detection method; energy management; energy storage; simulation; wind turbine"

The structure of islanded MMG based on the MA system is established and community MG is added to make full use of RES. The algorithm including two phases is established: Maximum consumption of RES based on SOS in Phase 1 is used to redistribute the shiftable load in time and space to reduce the residual RES; Energy dispatch optimization based on IMACA in Phase 2 obtains the optimal solution gradually through error adjustment step-size and weight matrix composed of unit cost and introduces artificial operators to improve the global searching ability. The purpose of IMACA is to overcome the problems of inverse solution and the need to clarify the operation cost relationship among each unit in the traditional MA consensus algorithm.

A complete resilience quantification framework is required to assess the resilience of a distribution system. With this objective, a framework for demonstrating resilience enhancement through the utilization of multi-microgrids (MMGs) and mobile energy storage in extreme operating conditions is developed in this paper. In the proposed framework, four resilience indices, that is, withstand, recovery, adapt, and prevent (WRAP), are introduced. Withstand index signifies the coping capability after the event, where the MG plays a vital role. The recovery index measures the restoration after the event ends through the system reconfiguration using MGs, tie-lines, and mobile energy storage. The adapt index shows the stability of the system before and during the events. Finally, the prevent index suggests how different resources are important and responsible for fast recovery and minimizing consequences. WRAP, as a resilience quantification framework, is formulated in this study, and indices are quantified and enhanced through the MMG and mobile energy storages. The IEEE 33-bus system is considered for this study, and simulation is performed with different scenarios and measured resilience indices. It is found that appropriate reconfiguration through the use of MMG, tie-lines, and mobile storages can remarkably enhance the resilience of a distribution system. © 2022","Active distribution system; Mobile energy storage; Multimicrogrid; Resilience","Recovery; System stability; Active distribution systems; Distribution systems; Functional capabilities; Mobile energy storage; Multi micro-grids; Multimicrogrid; Resilience; Resilience index; System resiliences; Tie-line; Energy storage; distribution system; energy resource; energy storage; index method; simulation"

Carbon emission limitation, regarded as a significant factor in energy management, has received increasing attention in recent years. By taking into account both economic and environmental factors, MMG networks can offer a great opportunity to reduce operation costs and carbon emissions. In this paper, we propose an optimal energy management strategy for minimizing the operation cost of an MMG network, considering operation constraints and carbon emissions. The energy management strategy is designed to consist of a day-ahead phase and an intra-day phase to overcome the uncertainty effects of renewable energy sources (RESs) generation and load demands. We first present a day-ahead scheduling strategy for the MMG network, in which microgrids operate in a distributed manner and share electricity while preserving their privacy. We then present an intra-day scheduling strategy for each microgrid, in which the operation costs and penalty costs caused by the adjustment of energy devices and energy procurement are minimized sequentially using a rolling horizon method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy in lowering operation costs and carbon emissions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Distributed electricity sharing; Energy management strategy; Multi-energy multi-microgrid network","Carbon; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Microgrids; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Carbon emissions; Distributed electricity sharing; Emission limitations; Microgrid; Multi energy; Multi micro-grids; Multi-energy multi-microgrid network; Operations cost; Optimal energy; Scheduling strategies; Operating costs; alternative energy; carbon emission; demand analysis; energy efficiency; energy management; environmental factor; integrated approach; smart grid; uncertainty analysis"

Several energy sources may be linked for the purpose of sharing load demand without being linked to the grid. The isolated micro-grid is made up of at least one energy generator, an energy storage system, and a load portion. Because there are several energy sources and a range of models, the power flow must be managed to ensure the safety of all hardware. Monitoring the flow of power from multiple energy sources necessitates adherence to many parameters and other requirements. As a result, the goal of this work is to identify a worthwhile solution for providing the appropriate portions with the necessary power while also obtaining the necessary energy from other sources. The approach is based on the fuzzy logic controller, which is an intelligent technology. This regulator is used in an efficient process that tries to control all of the equipment in the isolated micro-grid under investigation. The MATLAB/Simulink platform is employed for simulating this proposed system, and then, the depicted results were discussed and compared. Showing the traditional relay control, the standard PI regulator, and a neural control combination process, the achieved results prove that it is possible to reduce the battery recharge time to half; if the proposed fuzzy controller is used. Then, the established controller specifications have been used for evaluating the energy performances of the hybrid energy system under a real case situation in a specific location in the world. Consequently, the obtained results prove that this proposal power management system will be largely beneficial for such energy storage applications and an energy yield can be assured during all climatic conditions and specifications. © 2022 by the authors.

Nevertheless, problems related to variability and uncertainty of these renewables impose remarkable difficulties to control and operate multiple microgrids at distribution and transmission level.

To cope with this, a decoupled off-design LAES model was developed, and integrated into a micro-grid mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) design framework. This methodology enables studying the optimal energy to power ratios of LAES, and the identification of specific value streams of the storage, as well as optimally sizing the micro-grid equipment and LAES units simultaneously, to achieve the balanced economics and environmental benefits. The simulation has led to three major results. Firstly, the optimal charge/discharge power and storage capacity of LAES vary with the services it provides. The optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio are 8/3 h, 12/6 h and 12/6 h corresponding to the arbitrage, wind stabilization and operating reserve. Secondly, for a micro-grid with ∼50% of wind power, LAES presents the key value in supporting the system operation by providing multiple functions. It is split into six explicit revenue streams that can be stacked up for the first time, including the time shifting (13.2%), renewable firming (11.4%), peak shaving (28%), flexibility (21%) and reserve value (20.4%), as well as the waste heat recovery (6%). Thirdly, in comparison with the mildly reduced LAES capital cost and enlarged electricity price differences, a higher renewable percentage would be a major driving force to increase the attractiveness of LAES in micro-grids. The system design framework can determine the optimal sizes of the micro-grid components and the LAES units. Specifically, the optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio (27/14 h) and the storage tank size (608 t) of LAES in a micro-grid with 75% wind power are obtained, leading to ∼60% of carbon emission reduction on the 2016 level. The importance of this work lies in it provides the preliminary business model of applying small-scale LAES in hybrid renewable micro-grids, and can promote the optimal deployment of LAES under different scenarios in micro-grids. © 2021","Decoupled liquid air energy storage; Hybrid renewable micro-grid; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimal design and operation; Optimal energy to power ratio; Storage value breakdown","Costs; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Integer programming; Liquefied gases; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Wind power; Decoupled liquid air energy storage; Design and operations; Hybrid renewable micro-grid; Integer Linear Programming; Microgrid; Mixed integer linear; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimal design; Optimal energy; Optimal energy to power ratio; Optimal operation; Power ratio; Storage value breakdown; Optimal systems"

We develop and solve an optimization model to obtain the interactive power with the distribution network and the charging and discharging power arrangement for the energy storage module. We then construct a cooperative game model among multiple microgrids on this basis. Nash bargaining is used to coordinate the distribution of benefits among microgrids, as well as to analyze the optimal trading power and tariffs among microgrids. The research proves that the cooperative game among microgrids can realize the flexible consumption of renewable energy in the region. Microgrids also have lower operating costs.

Generally speaking, the power generation modules of an small and medium-sized isolated island energy system with off-grid power supply mode mainly include diesel generator(DIG) and distributed power supply. In order to smooth the power output fluctuation of wind and solar, coordinate the output of multiple energy generation technologies, and increase the penetration rate of distributed energy, it is necessary to develop a flexible and reliable energy system, and an efficient and smart scheduling strategy. In this paper, the power-to-gas (P2G) technology is introduced to construct a multi-energy complementary integrated energy system with deep coupling of power-gas network. Four possible game planning models are proposed by using game theory analysis method, and the energy scheduling strategies under each game mode are obtained by particle swarm optimization(PSO). By comparing the scheduling strategies under the four game modes, it can be found that the synergistic response of hydrogen and methane in the alliance cooperative game mode has absolute advantages in reducing the curtailment rate of wind and solar energy, balancing the income of each participant, improving the total income of the system, and saving energy and environmental protection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Coordination and optimization; Distributed energy; Game theory; Isolated island; P2G; Particle swarm optimization","Electric equipment protection; Game theory; Scheduling; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Coordination and optimization; Distributed energies; Energy systems; Isolated islands; Optimisations; P2G; Power; Reliable energy; Scheduling strategies; System strategies; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); detection method; electricity; game theory; integrated approach; methane; power generation"

To address these concerns, technology has evolved to enable the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) like solar, wind, diesel and biomass energy into small scale self-governing power system zones which are known as micro-grids (MGs). A de-centralised approach for modern power grid systems has led to an increased focus on distributed energy resources and demand response. MGs act as complete power system units albeit on a small scale. However, this does not prevent them from large operational sophistication allowing their independent functioning in both grid-connected and stand-alone modes. MGs provide greater reliability as compared to the entire system owing to the large amount of information secured from the bulk system. They comprise numerous sources like solar, wind, diesel along with storage devices and converters. Several modeling schemes have been devised to reduce the handling burden of large scale systems. This paper gives a detailed review of MGs and their architecture, state space representation of wind energy conversion systems & solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, operating modes and power management in a MG and its impact on a distribution network. © 2021 by the authors.

This work presents a model to empower an energy user to emerge as an EV-prosumer using vehicle-to-grid(V2G)/ vehicle-to-home(V2H) integration. The proposed algorithm uses an energy user's behavioural attributes ‘knowledge-gap’ and ‘risk-averseness’ to showcase the impact of EVs adoption on personal and societal benefits. Four categories of energy users are defined and considered to model the problem as per their behavioural outlook on EV adoption. The first two energy user categories inactive and active consumers are considered without EV integration. And, the comparative analysis of their personal payoff is discussed with the another two energy user categories considered with EVs: Type I EV-prosumer with single EV, and Type II EV-prosumer with multiple EVs. Further, the impact of an EV prosumer's emergence on societal benefits is discussed for two types of micro-grid (MG) settings: MG-I and MG-II. A mix-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed to optimize each type of energy user's welfare for V2G/V2H interactions in MG-I and MG-II, respectively. The model results confirm that improvement in the awareness and risk-tolerance ability of an energy user's behaviour on EV adoption empowers them to emerge as a grid-independent entity during the peak hours. Also, the objective function of an inactive user improves by 120%, 163%, and 147.6 % for an active, Type I EV-prosumer, and Type II EV-prosumer, respectively, with improvements in their behavioural parameters by 12.5%, 25%, and 27.5 %, correspondingly. The results show that the incremental welfare of Type I EV-prosumer is 63.5% higher than that of the active user, while for Type II EV-prosumer, it is as low as 25.2% than that of Type I EV-prosumer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Active consumer; EV-prosumer; Inactive consumer; MINLP; Personal benefit; Societal benefit; V2G/V2H","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Integer programming; Integration; Active consumer; Electric vehicle-prosume; Energy users; Inactive consumer; Mix-integer non-linear programming; Non-linear programming; Personal benefit; Prosumer; Societal benefits; V2G/V2H; Nonlinear programming; algorithm; behavioral response; electric vehicle; energy use; numerical model"

One term that is frequently dis-cussed in literature is the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability, as it is required by the utility grid to maintain its proper operation and system stability. Furthermore, due to their inherent ad-vantages, doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) have been widely installed on many wind farms. However, grid voltage dips and distortion have a negative impact on the operation of the DFIG. A dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is a commonly used device that can enhance the LVRT capability of DFIG compared to shunt capacitors and static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). DVR im-plements a series compensation during fault conditions by injecting the proper voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) in order to preserve stable terminal voltage. In this paper, we propose a DVR control method based on the adaptive noise cancelation (ANC) technique to compensate for both voltage variation and harmonic mitigation at DFIG terminals. Additionally, we propose an online control of the DC side voltage of the DVR using pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier to reduce both the size of the storage element and the solid-state switches of the DVR, aiming to reduce its overall cost. A thorough analysis of the operation and response of the proposed DVR is per-formed using MATLAB/SIMULINK under different operating conditions of the grid. The simulation results verify the superiority and robustness of the proposed technique to enhance the LVRT capability of the DFIG during system transients and faults. © 2022 by the authors.

Managing the risks that the participants in P2P markets are encountered is necessary to guarantee a sustainable penetration of such markets.

Through minimisation of total cost of operations, it provides operators with a visual daily operational schedule based on varying tariffs. This site is the first in the UK with a mixed operational strategy for biomethane produced on site: to burn in CHP (Combined Heat and Power) engines to create electricity, burn in Steam Boilers for onsite steam use or inject the biomethane into the gas distribution network - Natural Gas can be imported to make up shortfalls in biomethane if required. Implemented using a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach, results indicate that biomethane injection should be maximised for the highest financial gain - the driving force for optimising the remaining operations being the site electricity imports and whether the electricity imported ‘generates’ carbon emissions. Based on the source of electricity and the new carbon emissions performance criteria, under the current operational strategy importing electricity from carbon-based sources has no tangible impact on site revenues (but does impact CO2 emissions), however carbon free (renewable) electricity sources could see shift in operations leading a revenue increase of 12% © 2022 The Authors","Biomethane; Energy optimisation; Micro-grid; Mixed integer linear programming; Wastewater","Cogeneration plants; Energy utilization; Engines; Integer programming; Wastewater treatment; Biomethane; Burn-in; Carbon emissions; Energy optimization; Integer Linear Programming; Microgrid; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Operational strategies; Optimisations; Carbon; anaerobic digestion; carbon emission; energy use; optimization; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant"

Second, a novel relaxed condition that depends on the time delay (TD) is constructed, thereby reducing the usual constraint condition. Then, using the reciprocal convex matrix inequality (RCMI), some appropriate integral inequalities are used to process the integral terms to obtain a tighter upper bound. Next, based on Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) method, a new QMPI controller under AASCAs is designed to ensure active PSFR in MGs.

In this manuscript, an efficient hybrid approach to improve the dynamic stability of the micro grid (MG) is proposed. The proposed hybrid approach is the combined performance of Deep learning neural network (DLNN) and chaotic rat swarm optimizer (CRSO), hence it is named as DLN2-CRSO. To improve the searching ability and speed of the convergence, RSO is improved by the chaotic version of RSO. The proposed DLN2-CRSO approach is utilized the low-signal stability analysis under the entire operating points. The major objective of the proposed approach is the stability enhancement. To improve the dynamic stability through the integration of multiple distributed generation units in the micro grid, deep planning neural network is used. The control parameters of the DPNNs are identified by the chaotic rat swarm optimizer (CRSO) approach. The proposed approach reduces the reactive power mismatches among the converters and guarantees the stable operation of MG. The performance of proposed approach is authenticated with simulation outcomes, which is performed with MATLAB/Simulink platform.

By soft-coupling power and macroeconometric models, we assessed cost and economic (macro and sectoral) implications of electrifying irrigation activities in the Saudi agricultural sector via three scenarios: electrifying each individual farm with a dedicated hybrid renewable micro-grid, electrifying the entire farm cluster with central generation, and connecting the entire cluster to the national grid. Compared with the base-case, connecting the farm cluster to the national grid was the most economic but least environmentally friendly. The renewable and central generation scenarios were costlier due to high battery costs and gas infrastructure needed, respectively. Further, the financial viability of the renewable microgrid option depends on the opportunity cost assumption. From an economic (macro and sectoral) perspective, we found that: (i) job and value-added creation effects of saved-diesel spending from export revenues is positive, but quite small implying the more diesel displaced the more benefits realized, (ii) sectoral-specific spending is more growth- and employment-enhancing than general-spending of the government suggesting taking measures to further enhance the efficiency of governmental spending as highlighted in the Fiscal Sustainability Program. © 2022 The Authors","Agriculture; Diesel displacement; Macroeconomics; Renewable energy; Saudi Arabia","Costs; Diesel engines; Electric power transmission networks; Gas industry; Irrigation; Agricultural sector; Central generations; Diesel displacement; Global prices; Macroeconomic; Microgrid; National Grid; Opportunity costs; Renewable energies; Saudi Arabia; Economics; agricultural application; alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; diesel; electrification; emission inventory; energy policy; energy use; fiscal policy; governance approach; infrastructural development; irrigation; macroeconomics; policy analysis; policy approach; power generation; public spending; Saudi Arabia"

Different storage/PV capacities can produce the same level of quality service, but an optimal design is typically identified to minimize the levelized cost of electricity. This cost optimization however relies on technical and economic hypothesis that come with large uncertainties and/or spatial disparities. This article explores the sensitivity of the optimal sizing to variations and uncertainties of such parameters. Using data from Heliosat and ERA5, we simulate the solar PV production and identify the least cost configurations for 200 locations in Africa. Our results show that the optimal configuration is highly dependent on the characteristics of the resource, and especially on its co-variability structure with the electric demand on different timescales. It is conversely rather insensitive to cost hypotheses, which allow us to propose simple pre-sizing rules based on the only characteristics of the solar resource and electricity demand. The optimal storage capacity can be estimated from the 75th percentile of the daily nocturnal demand and the optimal PV capacity from the mean demand and the standard deviation of the daily power difference between solar production and demand. © 2022 International Energy Initiative","Africa; Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE); Microgrid sizing; PV microgrids; Rural electrification","Costs; Digital storage; Microgrids; Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Africa; Levelized cost of electricities; Levelized cost of electricity; Microgrid; Microgrid sizing; Photovoltaic microgrid; Photovoltaics; Rural electrification; Simple++; Solar energy; cost; design; energy use; meteorology; photovoltaic system; rural electrification; sensitivity analysis; solar power; Africa"

However, wind, as a renewable energy, is known to be highly variable and is unable to provide standalone power reliably within a micro-grid solution due to the variation of the wind speed at hub height, which subsequently leads to a variation of the power outcome. Here, a hybrid power generation concept is developed in which one gas turbine generator (GTG) is replaced with a floating horizontal axis wind turbine (WT) system. By setting up this system, the reduction of the maintenance costs of the GTGs and the reduction of fuel gas consumption reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In addition to this, the fuel gas savings in terms of the business side of such a solution provide a positive revenue impact. In this feasibility study, a technical framework is developed, followed by an economic framework. In the technical framework, wind assessments are performed to obtain the annual energy production for the selected field. Furthermore, an economic framework is established for both conventional and hybrid concepts in two scenarios: greenfield and brownfield, where the incremental net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of energy are calculated. The resultant difference in NPV for hybrid power generation compared to conventional power generation was found to be between 22% and 37%. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for WT is USD 165.52/MWh, which is 39% lower than for conventional, gas turbine-only operations. The LCOE for the hybrid approach is lower than for the conventional scenario by 22%. In conclusion, the hybrid micro-grid concept solution can harness wind energy from low wind regions with better economic benefits compared to conventional methods through the proper selection of the WT system, its floating substructure, and efficient micro-grid system for powering oil and gas platforms. © 2022 by the authors.","floating wind turbine; hybrid power generation; levelized cost of energy; low wind speed; offshore wind",

Current studies on shipboard PMS are mostly categorized as centralized, which are easy to be implemented and able to converge to the global optimum solutions. However, centralized techniques may suffer from the high computational burden and single-point failures. Considering the future trends of marine vessels toward zonal electrical distribution (ZED), distributed PMS are becoming an alternative choice. To achieve the ship high fuel-efficiency operation under high fluctuated propulsion loads, a real-time distributed PMS is developed in this paper that can acquire as good fuel economy as centralized PMS, but with faster computing speed. With a combination of filter-based, rule-based, and optimization-based approaches in a highly computationally efficient manner, the distributed PMS is constructed based on three layers that guarantees not only high fuel efficiency, but also sufficient energy reservation in different sailing modes and even in faulty conditions. Convergence tests and multiple case studies are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed PMS in terms of fast convergence speed, improved fuel efficiency, and enhanced resilience. © 2022 The Authors","Distributed PMS; Power management; Real-time management; Shipboard power system","Energy efficiency; Fast response computer systems; Fuel economy; Fuels; Ship propulsion; Ships; Centralised; Distributed power management system; Distributed power managements; Fuel efficiency; Multi micro-grids; Power management scheme; Power management systems; Real-time management; Real-time power managements; Shipboard power system; Power management; energy efficiency; energy management; fuel consumption; real time; transportation"

However, the volatility of renewable energy causes a mismatching for multi-energy flow in distributed micro-grid. To settle this problem, a standalone liquid air energy storage system coupled with cold energy of liquefied natural gas is proposed. A double-parameter regulation method is proposed to make the compressor cope with volatile wind power, and make the expander to meet the variable power demand. To improve the simulation precision, the dynamic behavior of packed bed is investigated and the link between the transient temperature of packed bed and system performance is achieved. The results indicate that the hourly power supply-demand in micro-grid gets balance by employing LAES, and the daily energy storage reaches 285 MWh which is more than enough for the energy demand in peak time (200 MWh). Moreover, the energy storage and supply gets balanced and the round trip efficiency reaches a stable value (63%) in the 8th day. In economic analysis, the short dynamic payback year (5 years) and high net present value (80 million dollars) indicate high economic feasibility. Finally, the proposed system obtains the optimal thermal energy storage density (96 kWh/m3), the minimum work consumption (643 kJ/kg), and the highest round trip efficiency (0.63) compared to those in previous literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Liquefied natural gas; Liquid air energy storage; Off-design condition; Power supply-demand balance; Wind power","Air; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Gas fuel purification; Liquefied natural gas; Packed beds; Energy flow; Microgrid; Multi energy; Off design condition; Power supply; Power supply-demand balance; Renewable energies; Round trip; Storage systems; Supply/demand balance; Wind power"

Installation of pumping facilities has the potential to resolve this issue. However, the energy used by these facilities is a concern. In addition, utilisation of the grid also contributes towards the carbonisation of the atmosphere. This work proposes the utilisation of a PV-battery micro-grid to power the pumping station. The size of the micro-grid is determined by the power required to operate the pump to mitigate the supply deficit. A pressure-driven model is used to solve the water distribution network and to determine the deficit in supply.

Energy autonomy helps to decompose a large-scale grid control into a small sized decisions to attain robustness and scalability through energy independence level of a country. Most of the existing energy demand forecasting models predict the amount of energy at a regional or national scale and failed to forecast the demand for power generation for small-scale decentralized energy systems, like micro grids, buildings, and energy communities. A novel model called Sailfish Whale Optimization-based Deep Long Short-Term memory (SWO-based Deep LSTM) to forecast electricity demand in the distribution systems is proposed. The proposed SWO is designed by integrating the Sailfish Optimizer (SO) with the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) is applied on the dataset, which is collected from the Central electricity authority, Government of India, for selecting the optimal features using the technical indicators. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB software package and the study was done using real-time data. The optimal features are trained using Deep LSTM model. The results of the proposed model in terms of install capacity prediction, village electrified prediction, length of R & D lines prediction, hydro, coal, diesel, nuclear prediction, etc. are compared with the existing models. The proposed model achieves percentage improvements of 10%, 9.5%,6%, 4% and 3% in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and 26%, 21%, 16%, 12% and 6% in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Bootstrap-based Extreme Learning Machine approach (BELM), Direct Quantile Regression (DQR), Temporally Local Gaussian Process (TLGP), Deep Echo State Network (Deep ESN) and Deep LSTM respectively. The hybrid approach using the optimization algorithm with the deep learning model leads to faster convergence rate during the training process and enables the small-scale decentralized systems to address the challenges of distributed energy resources. The time series datasets of different utilities are trained using the hybrid model and the temporal dependencies in the sequence of data are predicted with point of interval as 5 years-head.

Ideally, the micro-grid concept provides a viable solution to the energy sector, particularly with enormous microgeneration deployment. It addresses challenges attributed to geographically dispersed energy resources, including negative impacts on energy system operations and security. The specific climatic conditions of the desert, particularly the high temperatures in summer, greatly influence the consumption pattern in the isolated grids of southern Algeria. These extreme temperatures sometimes surpass 50 degrees, resulting in increased air conditioning systems. When operated at total capacity, especially during hot seasons, these systems significantly increase pick demands and weaken the production system enormously. Southern Algeria is considered one of the hottest places globally, which justifies its enormous power consumption due to the widespread use of cooling systems. Such consumption often leads to power cuts and shortages; thus, the need to pursue Micro-grid Integrated Hybrid System. This system integrates multiple electrical components connected through a robust distribution system. Such a hybrid renewable energy system is viable in this region because of its characteristic high solar radiation and strong winds throughout the year.

Against this backdrop, renewable energy (RE)-based farming has been a topic of serious discussion within Great Britain and Scotland. There are multiple advantages in the development and applications of RE micro-grids for farming communities as often they are located in areas that are quite remote and hence their energy sustainability provides security of supply. In the present article, a large-scale RE system that included solar photovoltaic and wind turbine has been critically analyzed with respect to its fractional contribution toward the total energy budget of a potato farm that produces 8000 tons of crops annually, with 4500 tons of the produce in cold storage for up to 8 months. The findings and recommendations from these case studies will help renewable energy practitioners in erecting and analyzing similar installations. © 2022 The Author(s).

The switch to bio-oils enabled by MGTs reduces not only carbon footprints but also operating expenses due to high transportation costs of fossil fuels. However, MGT efficiencies are greatly reduced at partial loads. This work investigates the feasibility of addressing MGT efficiency drops at partial loads by incorporating MGT with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to form a hybrid system so that the MGT can be operated at near full power at all times for better efficiencies. In this study, a daily power demand profile of a typical Canadian household is adopted for optimizing battery size and MGT operating strategies. By optimizing MGT daily start time and the engine's threshold partial load factor, the specific fuel consumption and battery size can be minimized for a specific number of households on a micro-grid supported by the MGT-based hybrid power system. © The Author(s) 2022.","Combined Power and Heat; Hybrid Systems; Micro Gas Turbine; Micro-grid; System optimization","Combustion; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Heating; Hybrid systems; Bio-oils; Combined heat; Gas turbine efficiency; Micro gas turbine; Micro-gas; Microgrid; Partial load; Power; Power demands; System optimizations; Gas turbines"
